# As per RFC 8314 (section 3.3), port 465 is preferred over port 587, but both
# should be supported.

# `submissions` means port 465. It handles SMTP mail submission, with encryption
# required using implicit TLS (explained below) and authentication required
# using SASL (also explained below).
submissions inet n      -       n       -       -       smtpd
  # Add this prefix to logs from this service.

  # Require encryption through implicit TLS. Implicit TLS means wrapping all
  # traffic between a mail client and our server (the entire SMTP conversation)
  # with an encryption layer using TLS.
  -o { smtpd_tls_wrappermode = yes }

  # Enable authentication using SASL. This lets mail clients attempt to log into
  # an email account on our server in order to send mail from it.
  -o { smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes }

  # Require SASL authentication for all connections to this port.
  -o { smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated, reject }

  # `non_smtpd_milters` is set in `main.cf` and specifies Milters (mail filters)
  # for processing mail originating from our server. Milters that apply to mail
  # originating from our server should also apply here, since this service
  # handles mail sent on behalf of our server from authenticated clients.
  -o { smtpd_milters = $non_smtpd_milters }

  # A Postfix cleanup service is a service that processes inbound mail by
  # transforming it in certain ways before our server receives or relays it.
  # Here we set this port's cleanup service to `submission-cleanup`, which is
  # defined later in this file with comments to explain its purpose.
  -o { cleanup_service_name = submission-cleanup }

# `submission` means port 587. It handles SMTP mail submission, with encryption
# required using STARTTLS (explained below) and authentication required using
# SASL (explained in the previous service above).
submission inet n       -       n       -       -       smtpd
  # Add this prefix to logs from this service.
  -o { syslog_name = postfix/submission }

  # Require encryption with STARTTLS. STARTTLS is a command mail clients can
  # send our server during an SMTP conversation which enables encryption using
  # TLS for the rest of the conversation afterwards. The STARTTLS command must
  # be sent after EHLO (the initial command a mail client uses to introduce its
  # identity to a mail server) and before MAIL FROM (the command a client uses
  # to tell a server the address its mail will be from before sending the mail).
  -o { smtpd_tls_security_level = encrypt }

  # Filter out inbound message headers that can compromise the privacy of users
  # sending mail from our server. The below file specifies the filtered headers.

  # it would filter outbound headers too, despite receiving servers needing them
  # or them not being set by our server anyway.
