# Each line in this file represents a DKIM key consisting of the key's name and
# then the following three entries separated by colons:
# 1. The domain name to sign for when using the key (or `%` for any domain).
# 2. The key's selector. A DKIM selector is what identifies which of our DNS
#    records other mail servers should use to verify the signature of one of our
#    emails. We use each key's name as its selector.
# 3. The path where OpenDKIM can find our private key to sign our messages.

# We only have these two DKIM keys which we alternate between every 30 days (as
# implemented by our `home/dkim/bin/rotate` script).
