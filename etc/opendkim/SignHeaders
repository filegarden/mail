# Tampering with a message ID would cause it to be inconsistent between the
# sender and recipients. For example, if a recipient replies to a message whose
# ID is tampered, the sender's mail client may act as if the reply is actually
# meant for a message at the tampered ID, rather than for the original message,
# possibly causing the sender not to find the reply where they expect it.
