# Also sign all the below headers so they can't be tampered with, for the
# commented reasons.

# Tampering with a message ID would cause it to be inconsistent between the
# sender and recipients. For example, if a recipient replies to a message whose
# ID is tampered, the sender's mail client may act as if the reply is actually
# meant for a message at the tampered ID, rather than for the original message,
# possibly causing the sender not to find the reply where they expect it.

# If more MIME versions are ever created, then letting a message's MIME version
# be tampered with could have future implications similar to those of tampering
# with `Content-Type` (see below).
mime-version

# Letting a message's content type be tampered with could let a middleman change
# the way the content is interpreted by other mail servers and clients, and it
# could affect how the message appears to a recipient.
