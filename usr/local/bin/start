# Run everything needed for our mail server in parallel, replacing this script's
# shell process (using `exec`) since the shell is no longer needed.
# * If one of the below processes exits, also halt the others so the container
#   can restart.
# * Ensure different lines logged at the same time don't intermingle.
# * Don't limit the number of simultaneous commands to one per CPU thread. All
#   these commands must run unconditionally.
# * Run these commands simultaneously, and in the foreground so `parallel` can
#   detect when they exit and stay open as long as they're open. Running these
#   in the foreground also makes their output appear in the container's output.
#   * `syslogd` is what handles system logs. `-n` runs it in the foreground, and
#     `-O /dev/stdout` tells it to output all logs to the container's output.
#   * The `crond` command runs `cron`, which is for scheduling automatic jobs.
#     We use it to schedule TLS certificate renewal.
#   * Run our `usr/local/bin/deploy_tls` script in `listen` mode. Whenever our
#     TLS certificates update, this gives Postfix the updated files and reloads
#     Postfix.
#   * Run our `usr/local/bin/deploy_dkim` script in `listen` mode. Whenever our
#     DKIM keys update, this gives OpenDKIM the updated files and reloads
#     OpenDKIM.
#   * The other programs listed here are described in our `Dockerfile`.
