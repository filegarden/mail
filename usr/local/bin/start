# * If one of the below processes exits, also halt the others so the container
#   can restart.
# * Ensure different lines logged at the same time don't intermingle.
# * Don't limit the number of simultaneous commands to one per CPU thread. All
#   these commands must run unconditionally.
# * Run these commands simultaneously, and in the foreground so `parallel` can
#   detect when they exit and stay open as long as they're open. Running these
#   in the foreground also makes their output appear in the container's output.
#   * `syslogd` is what handles system logs. `-n` runs it in the foreground, and
#     `-O /dev/stdout` tells it to output all logs to the container's output.
#     This is only needed for OpenDKIM. We configured the other programs not to
#     rely on syslog.
#   * The other programs listed here are described in our `Dockerfile`.
