# Create a `cron` job to automatically check every 24 hours if TLS certificates
# should be renewed. `dehydrated` renews certificates 30 days before they
# expire. (Let's Encrypt certificates expire after 90 days, so this renews them
# every 60.)
#
# This job should be created when starting the container, not when building the
# image, since otherwise, the job would still run during a `docker compose run`.
# It would try to renew certificates, consuming Let's Encrypt's rate limit, even
# though Postfix, the only program using the certificates, wouldn't be running.
#
# Before creating the job, generate a random minute (0-59) and hour (0-23)
# number. This will be the time of day at which renewal is checked every 24
# hours. It's best to randomize this to reduce load on Let's Encrypt due to the
# massive number of servers renewing at midnight or a precise hour.
